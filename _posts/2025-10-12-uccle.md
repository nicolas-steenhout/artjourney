An old house I did from a photo I took. And when I say "old", I mean... Built in 1570

![Line and wash sketch. There is a rectangular turret on the right of the house. The rest of the house has an A shaped roof with terracota tiles. The walls of the house are a reddish beige. The entrance door is in the turret, there are two windows in the main part of the house, with 3 smaller windows on the roof. The numbers 1570 are embedded in the wall in large cast iron numbers.](/images/uccle-1570.jpg)

Walking around the Uccle neighborhood, this house always grabbed me. I took a photo back then - I wasn't ready for sketching on location.

I'd love to go back - with my kit and the skills I've been building. It would be interesting to redo this on location.

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A5 landscape watercolor sketchbook.
