Track inspection car I sketched while waiting for take out. It was right around sunset on a cloudy day, so I was losing light quickly.

I've seen this thing many times. But only after sketching it have I been curious enough to look into it. I learned it's a track inspection car. Was used to... Well... Inspect the tracks. Turns out it was light enough for the workers to lift it off the tracks when a train was coming through.

Pretty obsolete these days - they've been replaced by trucks that can drive both on the road and on the tracks.

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A6 portrait watercolor sketchbook.
