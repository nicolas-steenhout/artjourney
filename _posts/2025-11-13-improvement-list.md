There are so many areas I want to improve in my sketching practice. One might say "too many"!

First and foremost, I need to improve my drawing skills at large. It's taken me a long time to realize that regardless of the media I choose to work in, a basic skillset in drawing is critical.

But here are some topics I wish to improve, specifically, as of November 13, 2025... This list is fluid and may change over time.

* Human faces
* Human bodies
* Water - lakes, puddles, waves
* Skies - clouds in particular. From fluffy white clouds to dark angry clouds
* Glass and reflections
* Sign lettering
* Cars and other vehicles

One sure way to improve these areas is to practice. Then practice more, and then practice even more.

The problem with that much practice is the risk of getting bored. So once I find tutorials and whatnots to help me improve, I have to practice, but not to the point of getting sick of it.

Looking at the sketch I attached to this post, a profile I three years ago, I think I was doing ok with this profile. Maybe I went backwards? Maybe I ought to try and do another one like this, and see where I'm at? Or would that be too boring? Ha!
