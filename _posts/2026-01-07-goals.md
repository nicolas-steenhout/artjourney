The year is young. And I realized there are two aspects of my sketches that I really need to improve: Values, and Perspective.

I do believe that working on values, regardless of colors, will make my work better. Ensure I have a range of values, from the page's pure white, to the darkest darks, passing by mid tones as well.

And the other element that would improve my sketches is perspective. That's an ongoing struggle! But I'm determined to improve there as well.

While I have a lot of things I want to work on, these two are likely to make my sketches so much better. So that's what I'm going to work on, primarily.

Also, I made stollen. I made it late. I should have made it earlier in december, but we were in the middle of a move, soooo, it didn't happen.
