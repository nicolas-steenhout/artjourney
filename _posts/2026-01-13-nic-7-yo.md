title: A notebook from a 7 YO

My father send me a notebook he kept from when I was about 7 years old. Going through that is amusing. But also makes me realize I'm doing, more or less, the same thing, all these years later.

![Line and wash sketch. 2 pages of a lined notebook. A child's handwriting (text below), and a drawing of a car and some kind of pole with stuff sticking out of it. Hard to interpret what I was thinking so many decades ago!.](/images/nic-7-yo.jpg)

The text (in French) on that page, reads: 

<p lang="fr">La nouvelle voiture de l'oncle Eloi a deux phares. Le devant est en tournant. Son bras de vitesse au milieu. Elle est rouge, ancient modèle, et décapotable. Nicolas</p>

**Translation**: Uncle Eloi's new car has two headlights. The front is in turning (curves). Its speed shift stick in the middle. It is red, and an older model, and is convertible. Signed - Nicolas

Obviously the drawing and the writing amuse me. Very childish. On some level though, I can't help thinking my handwriting's readability was better when I was 7 than it is now. Ha!

What strikes me most though is that all these decades later, I'm still doing drawings with written notes. I took a LOONG break from drawing like that in notebooks and sketchbooks. But the circle isn't broken!

Also, I'm so very glad dad kept that and then sent it to me. I wonder what other treasures he has in store for me.
