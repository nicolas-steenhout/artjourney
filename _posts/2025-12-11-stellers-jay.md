To keep my brain busy during a long meeting, I decided to paint a Steller's Jay, based on one of my own reference photos.

![Line and wash sketch. A Steller's Jay. Mostly blue with a dark blue, nearly black head. Viewed in profile. He's standing on a branch. Background in soft orange.  ](/images/stellers-jay.jpg)

This is the first bird I've done in a while. There are aspects I'm happy with. Others that I know I could improve.

But! It got me back into sketching. So that was good.

Also, I'm happy I haven't used black paint on that one.

It did look iffy during what so many watercolor artists call "the ugly phase".

<strong>Note:</strong> I was paying attention during the meeting. Painting is a way to quiet all the noise that might typically not let me focus on the meeting. Some people knit. Other people use fidget toys. Sketching works for me.
