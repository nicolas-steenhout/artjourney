I considered calling this one "Hands are hard"...

![Line and wash sketch. A hand that isn't following the right propotions holding an ice cream cone made of a waffle cone. The ice cream ball is pink. .](/images/cone.jpg)

Did this one based on an old photo I had of a waffle cone ice cream cone. Then added a hand holding the cone. Hands are hard - and this one is all out of proportions.

Still, I'm happy with this. 

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A5 landscape watercolor sketchbook.
