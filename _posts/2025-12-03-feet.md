Life got in the way of sketching in a big way for the last couple weeks. But I HAD to sketch last night.

![Line and wash sketch. My feet crossed at the ankle. One foot is bare. The other is in a checkered white and grey slipper.](/images/feet.jpg)

Instead of going to bed, I took a few minutes to sketch my feet. Because they are a handy subject, always there. 

I might end up with a lot of sketches of my feet over time!

I swear I don't have hobbit feet though. I blame my sketching skills.
