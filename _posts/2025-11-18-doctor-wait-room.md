I twiddled my thumbs at the doctor's office. What better way to pass the time than to sketch?

I didn't have that much time, actually. And it was interupted. So I ended up doing the sketch itself in 2 or 3 "sessions" in-between doctors and nurses coming in. Then I colored in the car in the parking lot while the whole thing was fresh in my mind!

(Just a routine visit, BTW.)
