<span lang="fr">Nature morte</span> is a thing as old as art itself! Here's a bit of a play here.

![Line and wash sketch. An apple in front of a banana on a brown table, with an AirPod case beside them.](/images/nature-morte.jpg)

Banana and apples, with the addition of a modern, inebible, touch with the AirPod case.

I think I overworked the shadows, especially on the apple. Looks a bit too muddy. 

My <span lang="fr">Nature morte</span> is moribund! Ha! 

I am pleased with how the AirPod case turned out though.
