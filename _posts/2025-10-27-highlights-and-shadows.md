I was listening to the Beyond the Lens podcast. One guest said "Embrace the highlights, protect the shadows". This is a common saying with photography.

The guest was saying that proper exposure of the highlights will be good. It will create rich shadows.

But it applies to watercolor as well. Protecting the highlights is working with the white of the paper. 

It also applies to life! We have to celebrate the good things and not really focus too much on the bad things. But we have to acknowledge the bad things and embrace them anyway.
