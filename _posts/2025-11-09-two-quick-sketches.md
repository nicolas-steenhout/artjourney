Squeezed two small sketches on the same page on my errands yesterday. Happy with those.

![Line and wash sketch. ](/images/2-sketches.jpg)

Spotted fire hydrants, and one of them had a safe spot to stop to sketch it. 

The other one was a tree with loads of character. I was losing the light quickly, but I got it done! I got distracted while doing it because a Great blue heron landed on a tree in my line of sight!
