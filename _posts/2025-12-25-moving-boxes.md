We're in the middle of a move. We have boxes everywhere. So many boxes. Boxes coming out of our ears.

![Line and wash sketch. Two cardboard boxes stacked on top of one another. The box on the bottom has the orange markings of a Home Depot moving box. The box on top is from Sentinel Storage. The background is dark, deep shade. ](/images/moving-boxes.jpg)

Only fitting to memorialize the event by sketching a couple of them! The weather is so appalingly bad anyway that going out sketching on location is... ARGH!

Also - Where have I put my container full of watercolor tubes? I can't find it right now. But I will need to soon, or learn to do without my go-to French Ultramarine!
