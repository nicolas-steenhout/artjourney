Stopped in Medicine Hat on our way across Canada a few years ago. The downtown area is FULL of neat buildings.

![Line and wash sketch. Old stone and brick building. August 2, 2022. Quick trip through Medicine Hat, AB. It was a warm sunny day. We grabbed some pastries. Walked downtown to snap photos of buildings. The sky was so blue!](/images/medicine-hat.jpg)

This is one of many buildings I photographed back then. Loved it. Unfortunately we were pressed for time.

But definitely want to make more time to stop in Medicine Hat, AB, and this time reserve some time to maybe do a couple sketches while on location?
