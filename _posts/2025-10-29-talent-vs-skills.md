So many people tell me I'm talented. Many people on social media say they aren't talented. I don't think it's about talent though. It's  about skills. 

There are very few "talented" artists. Some are geniuses and art comes easy to them. But most of us, from beginners to pros, we're having to practice. And practice some more. Some of our pieces are crap. Yeah, I'm not comparing myself a pro - I just know that pros also have failures. Less often than I do, but they still do. They just won't show that to the public.

To imply we are talented erases all the hours of practice we're putting in.

To not go ahead with practice because you find yourself not talented is doing yourself a disservice. It's not about talent. It's about skills building.
