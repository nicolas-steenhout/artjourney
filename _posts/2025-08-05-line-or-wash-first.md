Should you put down your ink lines first? Or your color first? There are different thinking about this. I typically put down the ink first, and color later. But I'm exploring the idea of changing!

A small garage to the right of the house, towards the back. A tall evergreen tree directly behind the house.

The first sketch is done from a photo I took in one of our trips. I put down the ink lines first. Then added watercolor.

I kept the palette limited to four colors: Payne's Grey, Burnt Umber, Permanent Sap Green, and Winsor Violet.

The second sketch, I put down watercolor, and then I added the ink lines. My proportions aren't as good (or should I say "more bad"?). The ink also behaves a bit differently - lines go thicker faster.

I'll be trying this again at another time. Because I don't like it now but looking at [Mike Daikubara](https://www.daikubara.com/)'s book "Color first, ink later", this shows promise.

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A5 landscape watercolor sketchbook.
