Trying a new thing - A landscape or "hero" image, with a "cartouche" (a small detail highlighted), and some text/journaling.

![Line and wash sketch. A landscape of a mesa in Wyoming. There is a cartouche drawing of the stone marker at the entrance of Fort Laramie. A handwritten note says July 20, 2019. Visited Fort LarAmie, splendid nisit, On our may out, saw these Mesas. Took a mhile to get here. Stormy, overcast skies were a worry. Another tornado? The landscape in Wyoming is just fantastic. I do understand people who find it boring! Can't wait to go back.](/images/laramie.jpg)

This was the first time trying this - I like it and am likely to try and do some more of it.

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A4 landscape watercolor sketchbook.
