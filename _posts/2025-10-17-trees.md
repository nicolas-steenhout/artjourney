This is my first "quick on-location" series. That tree got my attention.

![Line and wash sketch. ](/images/trees.jpg)

I want to do quick on location sketches as much as possible. Limit myself to 15 minutes. Small A6 portrait sketchbook. Ultra portable kit - so I can just grab the kit on my way out the door.

I'm not hoping for great art - but I think I need to churn a bunch of sketches from real life, on location, to improve.

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A6 portrait watercolor sketchbook.
