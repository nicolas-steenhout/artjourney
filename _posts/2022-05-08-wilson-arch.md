Crossing Utah, we came across Wilson's Arch. A huge sandstone arch. Took photos. Sketched it years later!

![Line and wash sketch. Huge sandstone arch viewed from the bottom of a small hill. There is a flower detailed in a cartouche, and some text. The text reads: Wilson's Arch, September 28, 2019. It was such a bright sunny day that day. But the wind was fierce. I went up the cliff to the opening arch, glad for the string holding my hat. A fine sand flew into the wind. Making it feel like I was getting sandblasted. Didn't stay long at that unplanned stop, but it was nice.](/images/wilson-arch.jpg)

Here I am, looking at this sketch more than 3 years after doing it. I see the crosshatching to create value and I'm unimpressed. It was one of the first times I did that. And it shows! Still, this is a case of progress over perfection!
