First, and hopefully not last, outing with Urban Sketchers Vancouver. We did a sketch walk that afternoon. I spent about 40 minutes on this sketch, while chatting with other people.

![Line and wash sketch. A bridge in Vancouver, viewed from a pathway at water level. There are two large square towers holding the bridge up. Several people are in the scene. One sitting on a bench on the left. Two sitting on a low stone wall on the right. Two cleaning up rubbish from the water's edge. The sky is grey and heavy. The tone of the image is dull - it was an overcast day with moments of drizzle.](/images/bridge-vancouver-usk.jpg)

I'm not 100% happy with this, but I'm not completely dissatisfied either. The one bit I'm actually happy with how it turned out is the series of vertical lines that represent the boats' masts in the Marina on the other side of the water under the bridge - I think that's really representative of the mess the masts make from a distance!

It was the first time I attended an Urban Sketcher (USk) event. Hopefully not the last!

There was a special guest, Felix Scheinberger - but that's a story for another post!
