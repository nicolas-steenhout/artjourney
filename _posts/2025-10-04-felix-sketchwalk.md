Urban Sketchers Vancouver organized a sketch walk with special guest Felix Scheinberger. I was lucky enough to be able to go, and learn a LOT!

I'd been wanting to go to an Urban Sketcher event for a while. But "life" has been conspiring against it. Lo and behold, I was made aware of a special event that I was able to join, and Felix Scheinberger was there.

Felix Scheinberger is a German artist, illustrator, author, and professor. His style is unique and I love his art. I have a couple of his books. I took one of his classes on Domestika. Having the chance to meet him was most excellent. You can find more about [Felix on his website (in German)](https://www.felixscheinberger.de/).

It was supposed to be a sketch walk - 3 stops of 40 or so minutes each. Instead, much better as far as I'm concerned! Felix agreed to do a mini demonstration. And it was amazing to see him do his sketch and talk through his thinking.

Some of the things he said that really stuck with me:

<blockquote><ul><li>Create a story, not a postcard</li>

<li>People and nature are more important than buildings</li>

<li>Quick and loose isn’t the goal. It’s a side effect of practice and experience </li></ul></blockquote>

There was an evening gathering and I was able to go for a short while. I asked if he would do a quick portrait of me, and he graciously accepted! My father said that the image is good but doesn't look anything like me. So be it! I love it
