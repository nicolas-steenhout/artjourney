I did this one from a photo I took in Paris, waaaay back in 2010! 

![Line and wash sketch. The scene is of a person, viewed from the back, taking a photo of another person standing at the entrance of an old arcade. This person is standing on one leg and appears to be quite playful. There are other people walking in the arcade in the distance. The arcade has a semi-circular roof.](/images/paris-arcade.jpg)

I wanted to work on the perspective on this one. And I think I did ok. 

I also wanted to add the people I captured in the photo, but not to worry too much about how "good" the people look. No, the person in the foreground taking a photo with his phone isn't me!

Done in Hahnem&uuml;hle A5 landscape watercolor 100% cotton sketchbook.
