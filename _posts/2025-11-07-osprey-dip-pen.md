One of the media that's intrigued me is dip pen and ink. Here's my first semi-serious piece in that media.

![Ink drawing. An Osprey on a fence post. To the right of the osprey are large sunflowers. In the background, low mountaints. There are clouds in the sky.](/images/osprey-dip-pen.jpg)

I did this as part of the final project for a course by [Chloe Gendron](https://longstrideillustration.com/). Originally found her on YouTube. I like her approach. And she had a free coupon for her course on Skillshare.

I learned a lot, and it was fun. 

This image is a composite between a couple photos of mine: The osprey, and the sunflowers. And imagination - all the rest.

I'm actually happy with it. It's far from perfect, but it looks all right and it tells me I'm starting to "click" with dip pens and ink. Also, I think adding a touch of color was a nice thought!
