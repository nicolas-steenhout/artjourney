## Introduction

I'm committed to accessibility. This website should work for everyone. Simple as that. 

This statement includes a description of my current, and future efforts in accessibility, contact information, and current conformance status. There are no currently known issues to be worked around.

## Accessibility Background
I've been working in the field of web accessibility since the early 1990's. I'm an expert accessibility consultant who provides accessibility training and consults with small and large companies. This site should be working just fine for everyones. The site conforms to WCAG 2.2 AA (as of November 2025).

Nobody's perfect though. This site is a hobby site for me, and I acknowledge I may have missed something. Please let me know if you're running into issues and I'll remove the barriers I've missed.
