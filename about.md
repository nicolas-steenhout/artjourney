One of my hobbies (I have several!) is sketching and painting with watercolor. This is great to get away from computer work. I'm not an expert, my art is unlikely to ever be lauded and sold! But it's good enough for me. Most of the time, it's not about the end result, but the process. I'm having fun with it. It's good for my brain.

## More Information

I've always been interested in art. I remember getting an oil art set when I was 8 or 9. It didn't go anywhere because I didn't get any instructions with it, and I thought I sucked, so I didn't proceed.

I got myself a huge set of colored pencils when I was in high school. But it didn't go very far either - I thought I sucked, so it didn't go anywhere...

About 20 years ago, I got myself a small Winsor & Newton Cotman (student grade) palette. I toyed with it. But... You might start to see a pattern, I thought I sucked, so it didn't go far. But the desire was still there.

About 3 years ago I got more serious about it. Got decent equipment. Spent a lot of time on YouTube, got a few books. Practiced. And didn't give up, even though.... Yep, you guessed it! Even though I thought I sucked.

Life got in the way and I had a nearly year long break, but it wasn't due to poor feelings about art. I got back into it more seriously in August of 2025.

I *still* think my work isn't what I want it to be. I still think I'm failing more than succeeding. But as I said earlier, it's about the process more than the finished result, a lot of the time. And since many people I show my sketches to seem to think they are all right, I'm learning to be less harsh on myself, even if the impostor syndrome is strong!
